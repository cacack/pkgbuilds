# pkgbuilds
This repository hosts [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgbuild)s that have been modified or created by myself for inclusion into the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).  Many of these [I maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=cacack) in the AUR.

## Repository Layout
Each package is contained within a subdirectory of this repository named after package.  The PKGBUILD will be stored within each subdirectory, and follow definied packaging standards:
* [Arch packaging standards](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_packaging_standards)
* [Perl packaging guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Perl_Package_Guidelines)

## Bugs, Comments, etc
Feel free to open issues or pull-requests on GitHub for any of these packages, but please add a comment in the AUR for the package if it is important for other users for the package.
